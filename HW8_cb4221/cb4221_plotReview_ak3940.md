Analysis:

Taxi data is definitely an interesting topic, but as you noted in your caption, it isn't really surprising that there's a strong positive correlation between taxi trip distances and fares, considering that the fares are based primarily on the trip distance. One thing that might be interesting is to look at the outliers -- trips that had really high fares for low trip distances or really low fares for high trip distances. You could then look at the other features in the dataset to see if there are any similarities among those outliers and visualize something about that.

Aesthetics:

-When you're using a scatterplot with a lot of data points, it's a good idea to lower the opacity so that your points don't just clump together into a gigantic blob.

-Your axes are missing units.

-Saving your plot at a higher resolution (at least 300 dpi) will make sure that the image scales better.

-Including more features might make it easier for you to get more creative with the visualization. The most important part of visualization is to communicate information clearly and getting too artsy can often get in the way of that -- but there are plenty of ways to visualize information that are more fun than scatterplots.
