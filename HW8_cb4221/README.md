For Assignment 1, we were instructed to make a plot. I chose to plot NYC Taxi data
showing the relationship between trip distance and total fare.

My plot:

For Assignment 2, we completed our CitiBike analysis from HW4.

Plot review by jz3309:
I think Christine Biddlecombe did a good job. The figure shows the relationship between trip distance and total fare on NYC Taxi data.

CLARITY: The plot is easy to read and the quantities were visualized clearly.

ESTHETIC: The colors of the plot clearly show the the relationship between trip distance and taxi fares. The graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities. Are the graphical choices allowing me to focus on the right elements.From the scatterplot I can see there is a strong positive relationship. The size of the plot, label and title are all aprropriate. I highly recommend Christine to fit a line and show it in the plot.

HONESTY: The plot honestly reproducing the data without deforming it.
