For Homework 10, I worked by myself.

For the first assignment, we continued a lab from last week's class, working with Ascombe's quartet, fitting linear and quadratic models to the data. Then, we found the Likelihood ratios between the restricted (simple linear models) and the more complex (quadratic) models to determine if the extra parameter in the complex model was "worth it".

For assignment 2, we worked with energy data from Local Law 83 and PLUTO data to investigate the relationship between energy use and number of units in a building.
