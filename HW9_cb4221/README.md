Homework 9

For this homework, I worked alone. I discussed some parts of the homework 
with Katharine Vorhees, Nathan Caplan, Eve Marenghi, and Ursula K. All code is
my own, with the exception of some code adapted from Dr. Bianco's Lab 8 
notebook and some items found on Stack Overflow.

For Assignment 1, I reviewed two of my classmate's plots. I examined the 
clarity, honesty, and esthetic of their plots and provided suggestions to
consider for future plots.

For Assignment 2, we worked with regression analysis (OLS and WLS) as well as
factoring in error measurements. We generated sample data, used Dr. Bianco's
function to create a line with our own slope, and also explored the statsmodel
function add_constant. 

For Assignment 3, we investigated relationships between gun ownership, homicide,
mass shootings, and other variables like GDP across a number of countries. We 
plotted various relationships, commenting on outliers or trends.
