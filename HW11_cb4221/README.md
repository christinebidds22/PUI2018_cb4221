For Assignment 1, I worked with Nathan Caplan, Ursula Kaczmarek, Eve Marenghi, 
Katharine Vorhees, and Martha Norrick. I did not contribute much to this homework
because I did not know how to do it! I helped look up some functions when I 
could, but did not contribute much else.

For Assignment 2, I improved my plot on my own.
