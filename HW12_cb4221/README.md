In Assignment 1, I worked with Ursula Kaczmarek, Nathan Caplan, and Eve Marenghi.
I received help from all of them to complete this homework. I did as much on my
own as I could, but needed help creating the for loop to download the data, 
filling the NaN values, plotting the data, and interpretation. I appreciate their help!

For Assignment 2, I worked with the same people. Again, I did not contribute much, but worked on the code 
with assistance where I could. 

Our task was to examine periodicity in the MTA card swipe data from the previous
homework. We also looked at new business growth from the Census Bureau to identify clusters
of zipcodes that were experiencing growth or decline over the past 20 years.
